 I see 
 I quit 
 Let go 
 Me too 
 My god 
 No way 
 Come on 
 Hold on 
 I agree 
 Not bad 
 Not yet 
 See you 
 Shut up 
 So long 
 Why not  
 Allow me 
 Be quiet 
 Cheer up 
 Good job 
 Have fun 
 How much 
 I'm full 
 I'm home 
 I'm lost 
 My treat 
 So do I 
 This way 
 After you 
 Bless you 
 Follow me 
 Forget it  
 Good luck 
 I decline 
 I promise 
 Of course 
 Slow down 
 Take care 
 They hurt 
 Try again 
 Watch out 
 What's up 
 Be careful 
 Bottoms up 
 Don't move 
 Guess what 
 I doubt it 
 I think so 
 I'm single 
 Keep it up 
 Let me see
 Never mind
 No problem 
 That's all 
 Time is up 
 What's new 
 Count me on 
 Don't worry 
 Feel better 
 I love you 
 I'm his fan 
 Is it yours 
 That's neat 
 Are you sure 
 Do l have to 
 He is my age 
 Here you are 
 No one knows  
 Take it easy 
 What a pity 
 Any thing else 
 To be careful 
 Do me a favor 
 Help yourself 
 I'm on a diet 
 Keep in Touch 
 Time is money 
 Who's calling 
 You did right 
 You set me up 
 Can I help you 
 Enjoy yourself 
 Excuse meSir 
 Give me a hand 
 How's it going 
 I have no idea 
 I just made it 
 I'll see to it 
 I'm in a hurry 
 It's her field 
 It's up to you 
 Just wonderful 
 What about you 
 You owe me one
 You're welcome 
 Any day will do 
 Are you kidding 
 Congratulations 
 T can't help it 
 I don't mean it 
 The answer is zero 
 What does she like 
 As soon as possible 
 He can hardly speak 
 He always talks big 
 He won an election 
 I am a football fan 
 If only I could fly 
 I'll be right there 
 I'll see you at six 
 IS it true or false 
 Just read it for me 
 Knowledge is power 
 Move out of my way 
 Time is running out 
 We are good friends 
 What's your trouble 
 You did fairly well 
 Clothes make the man 
 Did you miss the bus 
 Don't lose your head 
 He can't take a joke 
 He owes my uncle $
 How are things going 
 How are you recently 
 I know all about it 
 It really takes time 
 It's against the law 
 Love melove my dog 
 My mouth is watering 
 Speak louderplease 
 This boy has no job 
 This house is my own 
 What happened to you 
 You are just in time 
 You need to workout 
 Your hand feels cold 
 Don't be so childish 
 Don't trust to chance 
 Fasten your seat belt
